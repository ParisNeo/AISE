# Private AISE
A prototype for a private AI Sovereign Enterprise (AISE) that uses AI to generate profits and distributes them as dividends via a blockchain-like system. Built in Python, this project aims to explore solutions for a post-labor world.

## Features
- Simulates AI profit generation
- Tracks citizen tokens and contributions
- Distributes dividends transparently
- Logs transactions in a mock blockchain

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/Private-AISE.git`
2. Run the script: `python aise.py`

## Contributing
We need help with:
- Real blockchain integration (e.g., Ethereum, Solidity)
- AI profit simulation models
- Web interface for interaction
- Security and testing
See [Issues](https://github.com/[YourUsername]/Private-AISE/issues) to join in!
